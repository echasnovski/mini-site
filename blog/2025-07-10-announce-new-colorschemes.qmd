Hello, Neovim users!

For quite some time I wanted to have more ['mini.hues'](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-hues.md) based color schemes as part of ['mini.nvim'](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim). There is `randomhue` (each time randomly generated color scheme), but having something "fixed" is useful for demos and new user experience in general.

This coincided with the fact that for even longer time I was curious why there is no "time of year" inspired set of color schemes. So about 9 months ago I started working on it and daily driving each (dark variant) of them.

And I think it is finally time to release them. So please welcome:

- `miniwinter`: "icy winter" palette with azure background.
- `minispring`: "blooming spring" palette with green background.
- `minisummer`: "hot summer" palette with brown/yellow background.
- `miniautumn`: "cooling autumn" palette with purple background.

I personally enjoy `miniwinter` the most: I generally tend to like azure/blue backgrounds and yellowy/ivory foregrounds. And light variants of either `minispring` or `minisummer` look like genuinely usable light color schemes (which is rather rare).

Please, check them out and tell me what you think! They now (on latest `main`) come bundled with 'mini.nvim' or standalone ['mini.hues'](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.hues) repository.

Obligatory notes:

- The font is a [very customized Iosevka build](https://github.com/echasnovski/dotfiles/blob/master/fonts/.local/share/fonts/IosevkaInput/IosevkaInput-build-plans.toml) inspired by "Input Mono" font.

Thanks!
