Hello, Neovim users!

Today is the day for yet another stable release of [mini.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim), now version 0.14.0 (they grow up so fast). Here is a [full release description](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/releases/tag/v0.14.0) if you are curious.

------

This release marks only a single module coming out of beta-testing:

- [mini.icons](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-icons.md) - a general icons provider. It is meant to be a more versatile 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' replacement which relies on built-in `vim.filetype.match()` for a more fine-grained icon detection rules and which implements highlight group design with easier blending for any color scheme. You can also read [this release post](2024-07-03-announce-mini-icons.qmd).

This module came with a lot of extra burden:

- Switch existing modules which rely on 'nvim-web-devicons' to prefer 'mini.icons' instead. Those are 'mini.files', 'mini.pick', 'mini.statusline', 'mini.tabline'.

- Update popular color schemes to define 'mini.icons' highlight groups for a better "out of the box" experience for most users.

- Make changes to Neovim itself for a faster `vim.filetype.match()`. Unfortunately, this took **a lot** of mental effort to both get right and debate with core maintainers that it is even worth merging.

------

The rest of release cycle I decided to dedicate to clean up feature backlog and do overall maintenance. As a result, a lot of existing plugins got new and exciting features. Here are the highlights:

- 'mini.files' got the most attention: bookmarks, better file manipulation, and more. Here is a [separate post](2024-09-03-update-mini-files-bookmarks.qmd) about it.

- 'mini.completion' now also integrates with 'mini.icons':
    - It can show icons near LSP item kind (like "Function", "Class", etc.) after an indirect call to [`MiniIcons.tweak_lsp_kind()`](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/64e95aa77587d04f97a5579b2106a82a08a7d968/doc/mini-icons.txt#L481).
    - It can highlight LSP item kind. Requires set up 'mini.icons' and Neovim>=0.11 (current Nightly).

- 'mini.misc' got new `setup_termbg_sync()` function which can set up terminal background synchronization to remove possible "frame" around current Neovim instance. Or you can use advice from [this post](https://echasnovski.com/blog/2024-08-01-remove-padding-around-neovim-instance.html).

- 'mini.pick' now uses full height character "â”‚" instead of previous ":" to separate file name, line, column, and text. The full change is slightly more complicated, though, so see changelog.

- Many pickers from 'mini.extra' now also integrate 'mini.icons': both for file and LSP kind.

- 'mini.test' now can work on Windows. All that was missing was essentially a one line change in how pipe is created. Huge thanks to [@cameronr](https://github.com/cameronr) for [this PR](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/pull/1101).

- And many more.

------

Overall maintenance also was fruitful:

- Help pages now use Neovim-specific way of highlighting code blocks.

- Thanks to 'mini.test' PR, I was finally able to set up CI tests for Windows (and also decided to add MacOS). Updating tests themselves required a gruesome amount of tedious effort (as I don't have local access to any of those OSs), but it was worth it.

- All modules now uniformly ensure that their highlight groups are defined for any color scheme. It was not the case previously as usually the `:colorscheme ...` call clears all highlight groups before defining its own and 'mini.nvim' did not account for that.

------

Thanks for expressing an ever growing interest in 'mini.nvim' project!

Hope to see you soon with some exciting updates!
