Hello, Neovim users!

I am excited to announce the release of [mini.hipatterns](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-hipatterns.md) - new module of [mini.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim) to highlight patterns in text. It can also be installed using [separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.hipatterns).

------

This type of module did not have a high priority in my TODO list as I was pretty happy to use both [folke/todo-comments.nvim](https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim) and [norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua](https://github.com/norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua). But having just written [mini.colors](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/hipatterns/readmes/mini-colors.md) and [mini.hues](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/hipatterns/readmes/mini-hues.md) I thought it would be fun to make a future 0.9.0 release mostly about colors. Besides, it will replace in my config two plugins with one module, which I always enjoy.

I am also extra proud to note that this is a **module number 30 of 'mini.nvim'**. I didn't even imagine when I first started writing functioning Lua modules (around two years ago) that it will go this far. Yet here we are. I really hope more will come (it is definitely planned). **Huge** thanks to everyone using my work and spreading the word. It means a world to me during these tough times!

------

Here are the features of 'mini.hipatterns':

- Highlight text with configurable patterns and highlight groups (can be string or callable).

- Highlighting is updated asynchronously with configurable debounce delay.

For more information, see [help file](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/doc/mini-hipatterns.txt). See [this part](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/48b924e4f3b37f62246873d237a4a89704d88948/doc/mini-hipatterns.txt#L107) for examples of common use cases.

Please, check it out and tell me what you think! You can leave your suggestions either here in comments or in [dedicated beta-testing issue](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/issues/339).

Thanks!
